            FREDDIE's outer layer is made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or
            medical-grade PVC, serving as the first barrier against large
            particles and sediments. With a PTFE (Teflon) coating, it prevents
            contaminant buildup and enables self-cleaning. Its uniform
            perforations (1-2 mm) and stainless steel (316L) mesh reinforcement
            ensure a steady water flow, impact resistance, and durable
            protection.

          <p class="image-box-subtitle">
            In this initial purification stage, water passes through a
            combination of advanced materials. Sulfurized activated carbon
            adsorbs mercury and other chemical contaminants through specific
            reactions. Iron-modified zeolite exchanges ions and retains
            hazardous particles, while Amberlite resin efficiently captures
            heavy metals, especially mercury, even in low concentrations. Each
            material is optimized to work together, achieving highly efficient
            initial contaminant removal.

            This sub-layer reinforces the purification process using zero-valent
            iron nanoparticles, which reduce ionic mercury to elemental mercury,
            chemically trapping it. Quartz sand filters suspended particles and
            distributes the water flow uniformly, and activated bentonite traps
            heavy metals within its layers while preventing the formation of
            preferential flow channels. Together, these technologies remove
            remaining contaminants before reaching the device’s core.

          <p class="image-box-subtitle">
            The core is the heart of FREDDIE's chemical process. Here, water
            comes into contact with a specialized mixture of reactants: sodium
            thiosulfate, which forms stable complexes with mercury, removing it
            from the water; ferric chloride, which oxidizes elemental mercury
            and accelerates chemical reactions; and modified chitosan, which
            adsorbs heavy metals and stabilizes captured contaminants. These
            advanced reactions ensure that mercury is completely neutralized and
            retained.

            FREDDIE incorporates an innovative electrochemical system consisting
            of a titanium anode with ruthenium oxide, which oxidizes elemental
            mercury to its ionic form, preparing it for removal; a
            carbon-activated cathode, which reduces unwanted ionic species and
            adsorbs contaminants; and an ion-selective membrane, which ensures
            controlled flow and separates chemical reactions, optimizing
            efficiency. This system not only enhances mercury removal but also
            stabilizes the treated water.

            maintaining a constant flow of contaminated water toward its
            filtering layers. Its portable design makes it an adaptable and
