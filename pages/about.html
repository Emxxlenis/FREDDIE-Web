          <h1>Our Story</h1>
          <p>
            Our story begins in Colombia, a country rich in natural resources but
            also facing environmental and social challenges that deeply affect its
            most vulnerable communities. Growing up in these areas, where
            hardships are part of everyday life, we have witnessed the struggle
            for access to clean water and the devastating effects of mercury
            pollution, especially in communities near artisanal mining operations.
            These experiences motivated us to seek solutions that create real and
            positive change.
          </p>
          <p>
            We met in the classroom, a space where FREDDIE was born, driven by our
            shared passion for innovation and sustainability. This chance meeting
            turned into a partnership with a clear purpose: to combine our
            complementary skills to design a technology that not only protects
            people and the environment but also ensures a cleaner and more
            equitable future. FREDDIE is our response to one of the greatest
            environmental problems in our region, aiming to transform lives and
            bring hope to those who need it most.
