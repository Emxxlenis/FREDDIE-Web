        <p data-translate="home-slogan">
          Mercury contamination in water is a silent crisis affecting millions
          of people in rural communities worldwide, particularly those near
          artisanal mining zones. FREDDIE emerges as an innovative and
          transformative response to this issue, offering solutions that not
          only purify water but also promote the social, economic, and
          environmental well-being of the most vulnerable communities.

        <h2 class="section-title">A Vital Change for Rural Communities</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
          In many rural regions, rivers and surface water sources are the only
          available water supplies for families. However, contamination caused
          by mercury, resulting from its use in artisanal gold mining, turns
          these sources into a hidden danger. FREDDIE enables these communities
          to regain access to clean and safe water, mitigating the health risks
          associated with consuming contaminated water.
        </p>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
          Access to potable water not only improves health but also fosters a
          healthier and more productive environment. With fewer mercury-related
          illnesses, families can dedicate more time and resources to activities
          like education, work, and community development.

        <h2 class="color-box-title">Restoration of Aquatic Ecosystems</h2>
        <p class="color-box-subtitle">
          Mercury contamination impacts not only people but also aquatic
          ecosystems. This heavy metal alters water quality and harms
          biodiversity, affecting plants and animals that depend on these
          habitats. FREDDIE contributes to the restoration of these ecosystems,
          allowing rivers to regain their natural balance and once again become
          a vital resource for life in the region.
        </p>
        <p class="color-box-subtitle">
          The regeneration of aquatic ecosystems has far-reaching benefits.
          Cleaner water encourages the return of native species, improves soil
          quality in surrounding areas, and reduces the environmental impact of
          human activities.

        <h2 class="color-box-title">Impact on Public Health and Well-Being</h2>

        <p class="color-box-subtitle">
          Mercury in water is linked to severe health problems, including
          neurological damage, kidney failure, and birth defects. FREDDIE
          directly addresses this threat by ensuring communities have access to
          contaminant-free water. This not only reduces health risks but also
          alleviates the economic burden on families by lowering medical costs
          and economic losses associated with prolonged health issues.
        </p>
        <p class="color-box-subtitle">
          Improved community health has a positive ripple effect. Children can
          attend school without interruptions caused by illnesses, adults can
          work more productively, and the overall quality of life improves
          significantly. This strengthens communities, promoting their
          development and resilience in the face of future challenges.

            FREDDIE is not just a tool for water purification; it is also a
            catalyst for social and economic change. By ensuring access to clean
            water, this project frees communities from dependence on
            contaminated water sources and creates opportunities for more
            sustainable development. Additionally, by integrating social
            incentive programs, FREDDIE encourages active community
            participation in environmental protection, strengthening their sense
            of belonging and collective responsibility.

          <p class="image-box-subtitle">
            The problem of mercury contamination is not confined to one country
            or region; it is a global crisis affecting over 15 million people in
            at least 50 countries. FREDDIE has the potential to be replicated in
            various regions, adapting to the specific needs of each community.
            Its sustainable approach and ability to generate both local and
            global benefits make it a crucial solution in the fight for
            universal access to clean water.
